## DataSunrise with Amazon Redshift on AWS

This Quick Start automatically deploys DataSunrise with Amazon Redshift on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud in 20 minutes.

This Quick Start is for users who want streamlined database protection of an Amazon Redshift cluster by using DataSunrise deployed as a high availability (HA) cluster.

DataSunrise is cross-platform, high-performance software that secures databases and data in real time, and helps protect companies’ sensitive data from outside threats and internal security breaches.

DataSunrise supports databases and data warehouses that include Amazon Aurora MySQL, Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL, Amazon Redshift, Amazon DynamoDB, MariaDB, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Apache Hive, and others.

This deployment uses Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for PostgreSQL.
